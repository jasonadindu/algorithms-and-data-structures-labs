 A program that produces an array of all of the characters that appear more than once in a string.

For example, the string “Programmatic Python” would result in the array ['p','r','o','a','m','t'].

A program returns an array of strings that are unique words found in the argument.

For example, the string “To be or not to be” returns ["to","be","or","not"].

A program that finds the longest unbroken word in a string and prints it

For example, the string "Tiptoe through the tulips" would print "through"
